INTRODUCTION

A Ticket Vending Machine (TVM), also known as a ticket machine or a ticketing kiosk,
is an automated, self-service, vending machine that produces tickets for some means of
public transportation. (There are TVMs for other purposes, but the attention here is on
public transportation only.)
The purpose of the project is to create a set of interrelated artifacts for the problem
domain of the software aspect of a maintainable, secure, (environmentally) sustainable,
and usable TVM. In the rest of the document, ‘iGo’ stands for the name of both the
project and the product, unless otherwise stated.
